# Introduction to Cybersecurity Concepts

This project provides an introduction to fundamental cybersecurity principles, focusing on essential concepts and terms for beginners.

## **Core Security Concepts**
### **1. Confidentiality**
- Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to access it.
- Example: Encrypting sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access.

### **2. Integrity**
- Maintaining the accuracy and reliability of data.
- Example: Hashing algorithms can detect unauthorized changes to data.

### **3. Availability**
- Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and systems when needed.
- Example: Using backups and redundancy to prevent downtime.

### **4. Security Principles**
#### **a. Least Privilege**
- Users should only have access to the resources necessary for their role.
#### **b. Defense in Depth**
- Implementing multiple layers of security to protect assets.
#### **c. Risk Management**
- Identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential threats.

## **Basic Cybersecurity Terms**
### **1. Malware**
- Malicious software like viruses, worms, and ransomware designed to harm or exploit systems.

### **2. Phishing**
- Deceptive attempts to obtain sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.

### **3. Firewall**
- A security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on rules.

### **4. Encryption**
- The process of encoding information to prevent unauthorized access.

### **5. Vulnerability**
- A flaw in a system that attackers can exploit.
